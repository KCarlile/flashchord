## Functional

### Logging and Debugging
Enable debugging in the browser console by adding `?dbg=1` to the URL. This will tell Flashchord to send logged messages to the console for viewing. Then, use the brower's console to view logging statements.

For logging functionality, see the `js/utils.js` file and look at the following functions:
- `logger($message)`
  -  Log a message to the browser console if debugging is enabled
- `function logger_new()`
  - Start a new block of logging with a heavy line if debugging is enabled
- `function logger_break()`
  - Start a new sub-block of logging with a light line if debugging is enabled

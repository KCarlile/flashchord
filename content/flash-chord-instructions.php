    <p><strong>Flash Chord</strong> was created to help musicians take practicing chords, scales, and arpeggios to the next level by removing predictability and repetition. Flash Chord generates chords in a random sequence and with random qualities (major, minor, 7, etc.) so musicians have to learn the full range of their instrument without getting locked into patterns and memorization.</p>

        <h4>How do I use Flash Chord?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Set a tempo:</strong> set the speed of chord changes; start slow if you're a beginner</li>
            <li><strong>Set the time signature:</strong> choose the time signature for your the metronome</li>
            <li><strong>Select a key:</strong> restrict the chords to a specific key or leave it on <em>Any</em> to challenge yourself even more<br /><span class="small">Note: in the current version, specifying a key will override the difficulty settings.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Set a difficulty:</strong> pick a level that matches your abilities including beginner, intermediate, or advanced; if advanced is still too easy for you, you can also add chord extensions or hide the upcoming chord for the ultimate challenge!</li>
            <li><strong>Click Start:</strong> click Start when you're ready to begin
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Silent practice:</strong> if you'd like to practice silently with out the audio cues, click Disable metronome</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Click Stop:</strong> click Stop when you're done</li>
        </ol>

    <p>Once you've configured Flash Chord for your desired settings, grab your axe (instrument) and get busy comping chords, improvizing around scales, or running arpeggios against the chords being presented. Think of Flash Chord like a backing track or chord progression that is never the same! That randomized pattern is what is going to help make you a better musician by challenging you with the unexpected and taking you out of those same old, tired patterns.</p>

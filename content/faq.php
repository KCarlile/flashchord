        <p class="fs-4"><i class="bi bi-question-square-fill me-2 text-secondary"></i>Why doesn't Flash Chord work for me?</p>
        <p>Flash Chord requires a modern JavaScript-enabled browser, so make sure that your browser is updated and that you have JavaScript enabled.</p>

    <div class="border-bottom py-4">
        <p class="fs-4"><i class="bi bi-question-square-fill me-2 text-secondary"></i>Why doesn't Flash Chord provide a chord shape or the notes?</p>
        <p>Flash Chord is intended to be used by all instruments, so it wouldn't make sense to provide a guitar or piano chord shape to trumpet players or saxophone players. Also, Flash Chord is a practicing tool, not a teaching tool.</p>

    <div class="border-bottom py-4">
        <p class="fs-4"><i class="bi bi-question-square-fill me-2 text-secondary"></i>Why isn't there a backing track?</p>
        <p>We have plans to try to develop some backing chords, but it may not be supported by all browsers.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to help us develop this functionality, check out how you can contribute on the <a href="/about">About</a> page.</p>

        <p class="fs-4"><i class="bi bi-question-square-fill me-2 text-secondary"></i>I saw a weird chord that no one would ever play in real life. Why is that in Flash Chord?</p>
        <p>If you see an invalid chord, please report it on the <a href="https://github.com/KCarlile/flashchord/issues">issues page of the GitHub project</a>.</p>

    <div class="border-bottom py-4">
        <p class="fs-4"><i class="bi bi-question-square-fill me-2 text-secondary"></i>Why does specifying a key restrict the difficulty options?</p>
        <p>It's a temporary limitation until we figure out how to enable key restriction along with more complex chords. It's a tricky problem. :)</p>

        <p class="fs-4"><i class="bi bi-question-square-fill me-2 text-secondary"></i>The metronome hangs for a split second when I start it on iOS (any browesr) or Safari on Mac. What's up with that?</p>
        <p>I think it's related to resource caching for the audio file. I've added some tweaks to make it better, but I haven't yet figured out how to make it work perfectly.</p>

    <p>As an introduction, let's look at a brief overview of the configuration
        categories so you can setup your Flash Chord practice session
        for success!</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Tempo</strong> - Use the slider to adjust the speed
            of the incoming chords. Slower tempos mean slower chord
            changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Signature</strong> - Set the time signature to
            specify the beats per measure.</li>
        <li><strong>Key</strong> - Select the key in which you'd like
            to practice your chords or, for a real challenge, leave the
            key set to <em>Any</em> to see chords from <em>any
            key</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty</strong> - Select the complexity of the
            chords being generated:
            <ol>
                <li>Beginner: major, minor, 7, minor 7</li>
                <li>Intermediate: maj7, 6, m6, sus2, sus4, 9, m9</li>
                <li>Advanced: +, °, m7♭5, 7alt, 6/9, 11, 13</li>
            </ol>
            You can also specify if you want additional extensions (♯5,
                ♭5, ♯9, ♭9, ♯11, ♭13) added to the chords by checking
                the <em>Add extensions</em> checkbox.<br />If you
                really want to kick it up a notch, check the <em>Hide
                next chord</em> checkbox to get the next chord without
                any warning!
        </li>
    </ol>

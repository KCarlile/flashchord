        <p>Flash Chord is free and it will always be free. It's free to use ("free as in beer") and it's free to use ("free as in freedom"). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#%22Free_beer%22_vs_%22freedom_of_speech%22_distinction">What does that mean?</a> It means that you won't ever pay a dime to use Flash Chord <em>and</em> it's an open source tool, so you're free to see what Flash Chord is doing and how it's being done.</p>
        <p>That being said, Flash Tool is not "free" in the sense that it takes time to build and maintain. It also costs actual money to host and renew the domain each year. While these costs are not a lot, everything adds up.</p>
        <p>If you use Flash Chord, if you find it useful, and if you'd like to help support it, <a href="https://paypal.me/kennycarlile">please consider making a donation</a>.</p>

            </div>

        <p>We tried using Google AdSense to include contextual advertisements, but the site couldn't get approved for ads due to a couple of factors. First, the functional content is dynamically generated via JavaScript, so Google's screen bots couldn't really interpret what was happening. Second, Google primarily looks for frequent content updates and lots of text from which to pull advertising context. Since Flash Chord is a simple (but significant!) tool, there's not a lot of content here for Google to mine for advertising context.</p>
        <p>While we could seek out other forms of advertising, that really doesn't sound like much fun. Plus, lots of people run ad blockers anyway.</p>
